This is my The Odin Project assignment for a basic recipe website.
I created an index.html file, and added content for a basic home page.

After this, I create three separate html files for different recipes, using my knowledge of elements to create headers, paragraphs, and lists.

I linked the html files back to the home page, and also added links from the home page to each recipe.html file.

If you see this, I hope you enjoy!
